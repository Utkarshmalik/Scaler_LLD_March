1. Header
   The header typically consists of two parts: the type of token (JWT) and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

{
"alg": "HS256",
"typ": "JWT"
}

2. Payload

The payload contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims:

Registered claims: Predefined claims which are not mandatory but recommended, e.g., iss (issuer), x (expiration time), sub (subject), aud (audience).
Public claims: Custom claims created to share information, e.g., name, role.
Private claims: Custom claims agreed upon between parties, e.g., user_id.
