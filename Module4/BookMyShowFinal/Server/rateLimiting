Rate limiting is a technique used to control the amount of incoming and outgoing traffic to or from a network or server.

Purpose:

Prevent Overload: By limiting the number of requests a user can make, it prevents servers from being overwhelmed by too many requests at once.

Fair Usage: Ensures that all users have fair access to the service, preventing any single user from monopolizing resources.

Protect Against Abuse: Helps protect against various forms of abuse, such as denial-of-service attacks, brute-force login attempts, and spam.
