Websockets

Think of traditional HTTP communication as mailing letters (where you send a letter, wait for a response, and can't communicate until you receive a reply), whereas WebSockets is like a telephone call (where once you're connected, both parties can speak and listen at any time, in real-time).

Persistent Connections: Emphasize that unlike HTTP, WebSocket creates a persistent connection between each client and the server. This means that once a client (C1, C2, C3) establishes a connection to the server, it remains open for two-way communication until explicitly closed by either client or a server.

WebSocket connection as a "channel" or "pipeline" that directly links each client to the server. This channel is unique and private to the client-server pair.

Full-Duplex Communication: Illustrate that these channels are full-duplex, meaning that both the server and the client can send messages to each other independently and simultaneously without waiting for a request-response sequence.

Real-time Interaction: Highlight that this setup allows for real-time interaction. As soon as the server has new data (like a message or update), it can immediately send it to the connected client(s), and vice versa. WebSocket starts as an HTTP connection and then "upgrades" to a WebSocket connection through a handshake process. This upgrade is initiated with an HTTP request including a header 



 "rooms"  allows you to create isolated channels where a subset of connected clients can communicate. Clients can join and leave rooms, and you can broadcast messages to all clients in a specific room.
 
 Joining a Room:
Clients can join a room using the join method. This allows them to listen to messages broadcasted to that room.

Leaving a Room:
Clients can leave a room using the leave method. This stops them from receiving messages sent to that room.

Broadcasting to a Room:
You can broadcast messages to all clients in a specific room using the to or in methods.
