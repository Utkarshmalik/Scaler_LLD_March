display: grid property in CSS is a powerful tool for creating two-dimensional grid layouts. When applied to an element, it turns the element into a grid container, allowing you to define rows and columns and place child elements (grid items) within the grid.

suppose the container is of length 1200px.
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
Total frames will be 1+1+1 = 3.
size of each frame will be 1200/3 = 400px.

grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
Total frames will be 1+2+1 = 4.
size of each frame will be 1200/4 = 300px.

size of first column : 300px
size of second column : 600px
size of third column : 300px
