Concurrent and parallel are terms often used in the context of programming and computing, but they refer to slightly different concepts:

Concurrent: Concurrency refers to the ability of different parts of a system to execute independently of each other. In concurrent programming, tasks are divided into smaller subtasks, and these subtasks can be executed in overlapping time periods. The key point here is that the tasks may not be executing simultaneously; they may be interleaved or scheduled to run at different times, but they make progress independently.For example, in a multitasking operating system, multiple programs or processes may appear to run simultaneously, but in reality, the CPU switches between executing different tasks very quickly, giving the illusion of simultaneous execution.

Parallel: Parallelism, on the other hand, refers to the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks or processes. In a parallel system, multiple processors or cores work together to execute different parts of the same task or multiple tasks simultaneously. Each task or part of a task is assigned to a separate processing unit, allowing them to execute independently and concurrently.For instance, modern computers often have multiple CPU cores or even multiple CPUs, which can execute instructions simultaneously. When tasks are executed in parallel, they truly run at the same time, making use of the available hardware resources efficiently.
In summary, concurrency is about managing multiple tasks and allowing them to make progress independently, while parallelism is about executing multiple tasks simultaneously by utilizing multiple processing units.Concurrency can be achieved without parallelism, but parallelism often involves concurrency.
