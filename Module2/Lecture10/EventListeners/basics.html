<!-- Event listeners in JavaScript are mechanisms that allow you to listen for and respond to events that occur in the
browser or on a web page. Events can be triggered by user interactions, like clicking a button or moving the mouse, or
by other actions such as the page finishing loading or data being received from a server. -->

<!-- Event: An event is a signal that something has happened. It can be triggered by the user (like clicking a button) or by
the browser (like finishing loading a page). Examples of events include click, mouseover, keydown, load, etc.

Event Listener: An event listener is a function that waits for a specific event to occur and then executes some code in
response. It "listens" for the event to happen and then triggers a function, or callback, when the event occurs.

Attaching an Event Listener: You can attach an event listener to a DOM element using the addEventListener() method. This
method takes two arguments: the type of event to listen for (e.g., "click", "mouseover") and the function to call when
the event occurs (the event handler).

const button = document.getElementById('myButton');

button.addEventListener('click', function() {
// code to execute when the button is clicked
});

Event Handler: The function that gets executed when the event occurs is called the event handler. This function receives
an event object as an argument, which contains information about the event that occurred (such as the target element,
the type of event, etc.).

function handleClick(event) {
// code to execute when the button is clicked
}

const button = document.getElementById('myButton');
button.addEventListener('click', handleClick); -->
