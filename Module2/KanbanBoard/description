Brief description about the Project

The project is a web-based Kanban board application designed to enhance task management and productivity for individuals.

At its core, the Kanban board facilitates organizing tasks into a visual format, allowing users to easily manage their workloads and prioritize tasks according to urgency and importance.

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

Overview Features and Demo of the Project

Dynamic Task Addition:

Users can create new tasks via a modal pop-up, which becomes visible upon clicking the add (+) button. This feature is essential for inputting new tasks into the board, allowing users to detail what needs to be done.

Task Priority Color Coding:

Each task can be assigned a priority level represented by colors (light pink, light green, light blue, black). This visual differentiation helps users quickly identify task importance or categorize them based on priority, enhancing task management efficiency.

Task Filtering by Color:

The Kanban board provides functionality to filter tasks based on their priority color. Clicking on a color in the toolbox shows only tasks of that color, while a double-click resets the filter, showing all tasks. This feature aids in focusing on tasks of a specific priority or category, making it easier to manage large numbers of tasks.

Editable Task Descriptions:

Tasks are editable after their creation. Users can unlock a task to edit its description directly on the board and lock it back once done. This inline editing feature makes it convenient to update task details without needing a separate edit mode or pop-up.

Local Storage for Persistence:

The application uses the web browser's local storage to save tasks, ensuring that user data is preserved between sessions. This means that tasks remain on the board even after the browser is closed or refreshed, providing a persistent user experience.

Task Deletion:

Users can delete tasks from the board. A delete (or remove) mode can be toggled, after which clicking on a task will remove it. This feature allows for the easy removal of completed or unwanted tasks, maintaining a clean and up-to-date task list.

Priority Color Selection in Modal:

When adding a new task, users can select its priority color within the modal through a set of color options. This selection process lets users categorize or prioritize the task right at the point of creation.

Unique Task Identification:

Each task is assigned a unique ID, ensuring that tasks can be individually identified. This is particularly useful for managing tasks programmatically, such as updating or deleting specific tasks based on user actions.

Interactive UI Elements:

The application includes interactive UI elements such as buttons for adding and removing tasks and color selections for priority. These elements are designed to provide a user-friendly experience, making task management both efficient and enjoyable.

Responsive Design:

The project is styled with responsiveness in mind, meaning it's designed to look and function well on a variety of devices and screen sizes. This adaptability enhances accessibility and user experience across different platfo
