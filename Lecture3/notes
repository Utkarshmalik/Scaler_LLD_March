Forms 

Just like any other forms are used to collect information, in context of HTML it collects user input on a web page. 
They allow users to enter data, make selections, and submit that information to a server for processing. HTML forms are created using a combination of form-related tags and input elements



1. <form> 
tag defines the beginning of a form and contains the elements that make up the form
, such as text fields, checkboxes, and buttons.


2. <input>

The <input> tag is used to create various types of form input fields. 
The type attribute specifies the type of input field to be displayed.

 Common type values include:

<input type="text"> : text: Creates a single-line text input.
<input type="password"> : Creates a password input field (text is masked for security).
<input type="checkbox"> : Creates a checkbox for binary (true/false) choices.
<input type="radio"> :Creates a radio button for selecting one option from a group.
<input type="submit"> : Creates a submit button to send the form data.
<input type="button"> :Creates a generic button.
<input type="email"> :
<input type="number"> :
<input type="date"> :






<label>: tag is used to associate a label with a form element,
 making the form more accessible and user-friendly. The for attribute of the <label> t
 ag should match the id attribute of the form element it labels.



<select>

<select>: tag creates a dropdown list, allowing users to select one option from a list of choices. It contains one or more <option> elements.


<option>: tag defines an individual item in a <select> dropdown list. 





The <fieldset> element is used to group related elements in a form 
and is often used to visually separate them with a border or 
some other stylistic treatment.

<legend> element is used to define a caption for the <fieldset> element.





CSS



3  various ways of using CSS

They are:

External
Internal
Inline




 User-Agent StyleSheet

 The user agent stylesheet in CSS is a set of default styles that web browsers apply to HTML documents when no specific styles are provided by the author. 
 Each web browser has its own user agent stylesheet, and it serves as a baseline style for rendering HTML elements



 1. External CSS

You can create a separate file for CSS having the extension ".css".

2. Internal CSS

When you write CSS in the same HTML file. (using the style tag)


3. Inline CSS

It is writing CSS for a particular element. (using style attribute.)



CSS precedence determines which styles will be applied to an HTML element when conflicting styles are defined in multiple places. Here's the precedence order:



Inline CSS: Styles defined directly within the HTML element using the style attribute have the highest precedence. They override any other styles applied to the same element.


Internal CSS: Styles defined within a <style> tag in the <head> section of the HTML document come next in precedence. They apply to all elements of the same type throughout the document, unless overridden by inline styles.


External CSS: Styles defined in an external CSS file linked to the HTML document using the <link> tag have the lowest precedence. They apply globally to all elements of the specified type, unless overridden by inline or internal styles.


In cases of conflicting styles (where the same property is defined in multiple places), the style with the highest precedence will be applied.



Selectors 


1. *  : Univeral Selector 
2. Element Selector
3. Class Selectors  (.className)
4. Id Selectors (#IdName)


5. Descendent selectors

Anything down the order can be termed as a descendent. For example, a child is the descendent of their Father as well as their GrandFather.


6. Children Selector 


Child selectors in CSS allow you to target and style elements that are direct children of a specified parent element. The syntax for a child selector is using the greater-than sign (>). This selector is more specific than the descendant selector because it only selects immediate children, not all descendants.
